Will be going off of ESPN's 8 statistical categories:
FG%
FT%
3PM
Rebounds
Assists
Steals
Blocks
Points

IDEA: Relative percentages
Let users customize their inputs (slider system or something similar)

Calculate GEM Score, ideally average GEM score is 8 (1 from each category)

Custom equation as a weighted sum of all statistical categories

Developing of constants (updated totals as of 1/14, theoretically no need to update, one timeframe remains viable):
Total Games: 12693
Total Minutes: 282827.0
Total Points: 136060.0
Total Rebounds: 51491.0
Total Assists: 31119.0
Total Steals: 9847.0
Total Blocks: 5687.0
Total Turnovers: 16432.0
AVG FG%: 0.4527
AVG FG3%: 0.2988
AVG FT%: 0.7119


OK now to find the constants
x_1 = 1 / (AVG FG%) = 2.209
x_2 = 1 / (AVG FT%) = 1.405
x_3 = 1 / (AVG FG3%) = 3.347
x_4 = 1 / (Total Rebounds / Total Games) = 0.247
x_5 = 1 / (Total Assists / Total Games) = 0.408
x_6 = 1 / (Total Steals / Total Games) = 1.289
x_7 = 1 / (Total Blocks / Total Games) = 2.232
x_8 = 1 / (Total Points / Total Games) = 0.093


Think about like this
GEM = x_1 * FG% + x_2 * FT% + ... + x_8 * PTS

Where x_1, x_2, ..., x_8 are constant predetermined by default

So for an example: Nikola Jokic

            FG%               FT%               FG3%             REB               AST            STL             BLK             PTS
GEM = (2.209 * 0.605) + (1.405 * 0.853) + (3.347 * 0.435) + (0.247 * 12.2) + (0.408 * 11) + (1.289 * 1.4) + (2.232 * 0.8) + (0.093 * 29.6)
= 17.835 (far higher than the average GEM score of 8, which makes sense, its jokic.)


Now the algo is simple:
1. Take the slider value, lets say points
2. Divide it by total sum of all slider values to receive a percentage
3. Find the corresponding constant and multiple it by this percentage to find the new constant
4. Re-compute GEM score and filter players


!-- FILTERING --!

I want to display two main focus areas:
1. Best players overall
2. Hidden gems (players that have exceeded expectations) *

For best players, look at SEASON AVERAGES and filter the top k players with the highest GEM scores, simple

Now, for hidden gems this gets a bit more complicated

We have game stats (ideally), specifically the past 10 players for each active player

Now, we are going to do a window over just the past three games for simplicity.
Average the GEM score for this window and compare it with a statistical z-score to the GEM score of that player's season

Largest jump in z-scores are listed for player to player relativity

For example: Player A
Fetch game stats from the most three recent games (if they exist)
Find GEM score for each individaul game and then average them
Compare to their overall season GEM score and find a statistical z-score
Repeat this operation for every active player and display the top 15-20 entries

And thats it.
